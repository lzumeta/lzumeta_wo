I am a Biostatistician researcher at the [Biogipuzkoa Health Research Institute](https://www.biodonostia.org/en/) in the [Methodological Support Unit](https://www.biodonostia.org/en/support-units-services/methodological-support-unit/). I am interested in statistical modelling research, software development and applications of statistics, in particular, to the fields of Sports Medicine, Epidemiology and Biomedicine.

I obtained a PhD in Mathematics and Statistics. My PhD focused on the development of statistical methods and software for the estimation of injury risk and incidence in the context of professional football.
